# Salazar â€“ Snake Classifier

Salazar is a minimalistic web app that classifies snake images as **Venomous** or **Non-Venomous** using a pre-trained deep learning model. The app is built with **Streamlit** and TensorFlow.

## Features

- Upload a snake image and get an instant prediction.
- Pre-trained model optimized for accurate classification.
- Simple, clean, and interactive user interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salazar-snake-classifier.git
cd salazar-snake-classifier
````

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the app locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Upload an image of a snake (`jpg` or `png`).
* The app will display the predicted class: **Venomous** or **Non-Venomous**.

## Model

* The model is trained on a curated snake dataset on Kaggle: *"Snake Dataset - India"*.
* Saved as `snake_classifier_model.keras`.
* Uses **MobileNetV2** as the base model with transfer learning.
